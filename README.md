#MoneyTransferProgram

###Description of the task
This program performs a money transfer from one account to another.
Previously, the program contains a file with account numbers and amounts
on them. At startup, the program should wait for information to be entered from the console. When selecting the parsing function, the program must parse all suitable files from the ‘input’ directory and transfer the parsed files to another ‘archive’ directory. As a result of file parsing, the program must generate/update a report file and update the information in the file with account numbers and amounts to the latest ones.

###Technical implementation details
At startup, the program waits for information input:
1 is entered into the console - calling the operation of parsing translation files from input,
2 is entered into the console - calling the operation of displaying a list of all translations from the report file.
